Automated email bots based on two different types of dependencies (personally, I think Redmail is better). 

1. Based on redmail and integrated with *schedule* package to send email reports at specific times and days. This one also allows email to be sent with imbeded pictures, graphs, and tables.
2. Based on yagmail. Less sophisticated, but works.
